  description: " \tThe adult mammalian heart is incapable of regeneration following\
    \ injury. In contrast, the neonatal mouse heart can efficiently regenerate during\
    \ the first week of life. The molecular mechanisms that mediate the regenerative\
    \ response and its blockade in later life are not understood. Here, by single-nucleus\
    \ RNA sequencing, we map the dynamic transcriptional landscape of five distinct\
    \ cardiomyocyte populations in healthy, injured and regenerating mouse hearts.\
    \ We identify immature cardiomyocytes that enter the cell-cycle following injury\
    \ and disappear as the heart loses the ability to regenerate. These proliferative\
    \ neonatal cardiomyocytes display a unique transcriptional program dependent on\
    \ NFYa and NFE2L1 transcription factors, which exert proliferative and protective\
    \ functions, respectively. Cardiac overexpression of these two factors conferred\
    \ protection against ischemic injury in mature mouse hearts that were otherwise\
    \ non-regenerative. These findings advance our understanding of the cellular basis\
    \ of neonatal heart regeneration and reveal a transcriptional landscape for heart\
    \ repair following injury. "
