# Adding values to a whitelist

For this example, we will extend the whitelist for 'reference_genome' with the reference genomes for zebrafish (danrer10, danrer11). This whitelist is created as a whitelist of type 'group'. To show the extension of whitelists of different types, it is converted to a 'plain' and 'depend' format for this example as well.

### Step 1: Finding the whitelist file and opening it in the web editor

Go to the [whitelist folder](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/loosolab/software/metadata-organizer/-/tree/main/whitelists) in the repository. There, look for the file whose name matches the key whose possible values you want to extend. In this example, this is the file named 'reference_genome'.

Open this file. Inside Github you will see a blue button 'Open in Web IDE' in the upper right corner.

Clicking on it will open an editor where you can edit the selected whitelist.

### Step 2: Adding new values to the file

In the following table, the whitelist for 'reference_genome' is shown and expanded for each of the formats 'plain', 'group' and 'depend'.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
plain
</th>
<th>
group
</th>
<th>
depend
</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">

<div>

The following snippet <br>
shows the whitelist file <br>
for 'reference_genome' in<br> 
type 'plain'.

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
  - hg38
  - hg19
  - mm10
  - mm9
  - mm38
```

To add the reference <br>
genomes 'danrer10' and <br>
'danrer11' to a whitelist<br> 
of type 'plain', they are<br> 
inserted into the list <br>
under key "whitelist":

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
  - hg38
  - hg19
  - mm10
  - mm9
  - mm38
  - danrer10
  - danrer11
```

</div>
</td> 
<td> 
<div>

The following snippet <br>
shows the whitelist file <br>
for 'reference_genome' in<br> 
type 'group'.

```yaml
whitelist_type: group
whitelist:
    human:
      - hg38
      - hg19
    mouse:
      - mm10
      - mm9
      - mm38
```

In the 'group' type <br>
whitelist, the specified<br> 
reference genomes are <br>
grouped according to the <br>
organism to which they <br>
are assigned. To add the <br>
reference genomes <br>   
'danrer10' and 'danrer11'<br> 
of the organism zebrafish<br> 
in a meaningful way, we <br>
create the new category <br>
'zebrafish' as a key <br>
within the dictionary <br>
under 'whitelist'. This <br>
key 'zebrafish' then gets<br> 
'danrer10' and 'danrer11'<br> 
in a list as value.

```yaml
whitelist_type: group
whitelist:
    human:
      - hg38
      - hg19
    mouse:
      - mm10
      - mm9
      - mm38
  zebrafish:
      - danrer10
      - danrer11
```

</div>
</td>
<td markdown="1"> 

The following snippet <br>
shows the whitelist file <br>
for 'reference_genome' in<br> 
type 'depend'.

```yaml
whitelist_type: depend
ident_key: organism_name
whitelist:
    human:
      - hg38
      - hg19
    mouse:
      - mm10
      - mm9
      - mm38
```

The whitelist of type <br>
'depend' is dependent on <br>
the input of another <br>
metadata field. The <br> 
'ident_key' indicates <br>
that this metadata field <br>
is the 'organism_name' in<br> 
our example. This means <br>
that different whitelist <br>
values can be entered for<br> 
the reference genome <br>
depending on the <br>    
specified organism. Now, <br>
to add the reference <br>
genomes 'danrer10' and <br>
'danrer11', we first have<br> 
to decide for which <br> 
organism our reference <br>
genomes are valid. For <br>
this we look at the <br> 
possible organisms in the<br>
 whitelist 'organism'[1]:

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
headers: organism_name taxonomy_id
whitelist:
    - human 9606
    - mouse 10090
    - zebrafish 7955
    - rat 10114
    - pig 9823
    - medaka 8090
    - chicken 9031
    - drosophila 7215
    - yeast 4932
```

In this whitelist we find<br>
an entry for zebrafish. <br>
From the header we see <br>
that the entry is <br>   
composed of the <br>     
'organism_name' and the <br>
'taxonomy_id'. So for the<br> 
entry 'zebrafish 7955' we<br> 
get the 'organism_name' <br>
'zebrafish'. We now enter<br> 
this as a key in the <br>
dictionary under <br>    
'whitelist' in our <br>  
'reference_genome' <br>  
whitelist. Note that the <br>
syntax of the key must <br>
match the 'organism_name'<br> 
specified in the <br>    
'organism' whitelist. <br>
Then, this new key <br>
'zebrafish' receives a <br>
list containing the <br>
reference genomes <br>
'danrer10' and 'danrer11'<br> 
as value.

```yaml
whitelist_type: depend
ident_key: organism_name
whitelist:
    human:
      - hg38
      - hg19
    mouse:
      - mm10
      - mm9
      - mm38
    zebrafish:
      - danrer10
      - danrer11
```

__abbrev__:

Abbreviation whitelists are created for all values and keys that can occur in generated file names. This concerns all experimental factors and their values, as well as all organism names. In this example, an experimental factor 'injury' was added to the whitelist 'factor', for which an abbreviation must now be created in the abbreviation whitelist of 'factor'.

<th>
factor
</th>

</th>

<tr>
<td>
The illustrated yaml file shows the whitelist for experimental <br>
factors where 'injury' has been added.
</td>
<td>
A new key must now be added to the abbreviation whitelist for <br>
'injury'. This key 'injury' then contains an abbreviation as <br>
value. Abbreviations may only contain letters and numbers. <br>
Please note that the created abbreviation may only appear once <br>
in the whitelist. For 'injury' the abbreviation 'inj' was <br>
defined.
