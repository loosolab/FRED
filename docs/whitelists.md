## Whitelist storage

The whitelists for the project are located in the Git repository '[metadata_whitelists](https://github.com/loosolab/whitelists/)' inside the 'whitelists' folder. All newly created whitelist files must also be placed in this folder so that the metadata tool can read them.

The naming of the whitelists is identical to the key for which it is created. For example, the whitelist for the key 'organism' is also named 'organism'. 

The whitelist files have the format yaml. For each whitelist two mandatory keys must be specified. The first one is 'whitelist_type' and describes the nature of the whitelist and how it must be processed in the program. There are four different whitelist types, which are described in more detail in the sections below.
The second mandatory key is called 'whitelist' and contains the values that can be accepted by the metadata field for which the whitelist was created.

## Whitelist types

### Type 1: plain

Whitelists of type plain are the simplest way to set values for a metadata field. A simple list of potential values is specified for the key whitelist. 

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th>
whitelists/gender
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
  - male
  - female
  - mixed
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Type 2: group

This whitelist type is used to group the values within the whitelist for better organization. Here, the key whitelist receives a dictionary as value, whose keys represent subheadings. For these keys, thematically matching values are then stored in a list. When generating the metadata, the whitelist values are output in the same grouping as defined in the whitelist file. The aim of this whitelist type is to improve the clarity when creating and extending the whitelists as well as when generating the metadata file.

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th>
whitelists/disease_type
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
The whitelist values for 'disease_type' were grouped based on the organs affected by the disease.<br>
This allows faster finding of diseases in the list, as well as a better overview.
</div>
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: group
whitelist:
  lung:
    - lung cancer
    - COPD
    - PH
    ...
  heart:
    - Coronary heart disease CHD
    - Angina
    - Blood pressure
    ...
  other:
    - breast cancer
    - prostate cancer
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>



### Type 3: depend

This type of whitelist is used when the values depend on the input of another key in the metadata structure. Each whitelist file of type depend contains beside 'whitelist_type' and 'whitelist' the further mandatory key 'ident_key'. This identifies the key in the metadata structure on whose input the whitelist should depend. For example, if you want to make the whitelist for genes dependent on the organism under investigation, set the value for 'ident_key' to 'organism_name'.
The key 'whitelist' receives a dictionary whose keys represent the possible values of the metadata field specified in 'ident_key'. These keys are then assigned the values in a list, which an input can accept depending on this key.

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th>
whitelists/reference_genome
</th>
<th>
whitelists/organism
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
In this example, the whitelist for the reference<br>
genome is represented as depending on the<br> 
organism.For this reason, the 'ident_key' is<br> 
assigned 'organism_name'. The possible organisms<br> 
form the keys specified under 'whitelist'. Their<br>
values are those reference genomes that can be<br> 
set for the respective organism.
</div>
</td> 
<td> 
<div>
The whitelist for 'organism_name' contains<br> 
all allowed organisms as values. These form<br> 
the keys in the dependent whitelist<br> 
'reference_genome'.
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: depend
ident_key: organism_name
whitelist:
  human_9606:
    - hg38
    - hg19
  mouse_10090:
    - mm10
    - mm9
    - mm38
  zebrafish_7955:
    - danrer11
    - danrer10
  ...
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
  - human_9606
  - mouse_10090
  - zebrafish_7955
  ...
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Type 4: abbrev

This type of whitelist must be provided for all experimental factors, their values, and for the organisms. The fields mentioned are those from which file names for samples are generated during metadata creation. Since file names are limited in length, the values must be shortened using the abbrev whitelist. In this process, all special characters are also removed from the values.
Whitelists of type abbrev are located inside the 'whitelists' folder in the 'abbrev' folder. They are named after the key for whose values they contain the abbreviations.  
Here a dictionary is passed to the key 'whitelist'. The keys of this dictionary correspond to the values of the non-abbreviated whitelist. Each key receives its abbreviated version. If an non-abbreviated value has only a short length and does not contain any special characters, it does not have to be specified in the abbrev whitelist. In such a case it will be included unchanged in the filename.

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th>
whitelists/abbrev/gender
</th>
<th>
whitelists/organism
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
In this example, the abbrev whitelist was<br> 
created for the experimental factor gender.
</div>
</td> 
<td> 
<div>
Here you can see the non-abbreviated gender<br> 
whitelist for comparison.
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: abbrev
whitelist:
  male: m
  female: f
  mixed: x
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
  - male
  - female
  - mixed
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

A special case to be considered is when an experimental factor can take a dictionary as its value. In this case, not only the possible values for the keys within the dictionary, but also the key names themselves must be abbreviated.

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Extract for disease from <br>
keys.yaml
</th>
<th>
whitelists/abbrev/disease
</th>
<th>
whitelists/abbrev/disease_status<br>
whitelists/abbrev/disease_type
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
As shown in the extract from <br>
keys.yaml, the experimental <br>
factor disease is divided <br>
into the subdomains status, <br>
type, and stage using an <br>
underlying dictionary.
</div>
</td> 
<td> 
<div>
Abbreviations must be created <br>
for the keys disease_status, <br>
disease_type and disease_stage<br> 
which are included in disease,<br> 
since these keys are also <br>
written in the file name.
</div>
</td>
<td> 
<div>
Here you can see the <br>
abbreviated whitelists for the <br>
values of the keys. For <br>
disease_stage no abbrev <br>
whitelist was created, because <br>
the included values are already<br>
very short and do not contain <br>
any special characters.
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
disease:
  ...
  value:
    disease_type:
      ...
    disease_status:
      ...
    disease_stage:
      ...              

```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: abbrev
whitelist:
  disease_status: sts
  disease_type: tp
  disease_stage: stg
```

</td>
<td>
<b>disease_status:</b>

```yaml
whitelist_type: abbrev
whitelist:
    healthy: hlth
    recovered: rcvd
```

<b>disease_type:</b>

```yaml
whitelist_type: abbrev
whitelist:
    Lung cancer: LngCnc
    Asthma: Asth
    Pneumonia: pneum
    ...
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Linking whitelists

### Linking to existing whitelists

In addition to specifying possible values in the form of a list under the key 'whitelist', it is also possible to link to existing whitelist files. This is useful if the possible values of two different metadata fields are the same. In this case it is sufficient to create the values for only one of these fields and to link to the already created values in the whitelist of the other field. This way the values only have to be maintained in one place.
The following examples show how such a link can be built into various whitelists.

__Example 1 : plain__

This example shows what a link in a whitelist of type 'plain' can look like. Assume that a key setting_technique appears in the experimental setting section whereas a key technique is located in the technical details section. The former represents the measurement technique used for the respective experimental setting. The latter summarizes all measurement techniques used in the experiment. The possible techniques are the same in both fields.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
Extract for technique from <br>
keys.yaml
</th>
<th>
whitelists/technique
</th>
<th>
whitelists/setting_technique<br>
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
For this example it is assumed that<br> 
under 'experimental_setting' a new <br>
key 'setting_technique' is added, <br>
which contains the measurement of <br>
the samples per experimental <br>  
setting. All used techniques are <br>
then summarized again in a list <br>
under 'technical_details'.
</div>
</td> 
<td> 
<div>
In the whitelist for technique all <br>
possible techniques for sample <br>
measurement are already defined.
</div>
</td>
<td> 
<div>
For the whitelist <br>
'setting_technique' the values can <br>
be adopted from the whitelist <br>
'technique' by specifying its path <br>
under the key 'whitelist'. 
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
experimental_setting:
  ...
  value:
    setting_technique:
      mandatory: True
      list: False
      display_name: 'Technique'
      desc: ''
      value: null
      whitelist: True
      input_type: select
technical_details:
  ...
  value:
    technique:
      mandatory: True
      list: True
      display_name: 'Technique'
      desc: ''
      value: null
      whitelist: True
      input_type: select

```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
    - bulk RNA-seq
    - bulk RNA array
    - bulk ATAC-seq
    - bulk ChIP-seq
    ...
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist: technique
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


__Example 2 : group__

This example shows how a link in a whitelist of type "group" can look like. For this we consider the whitelist of 'enrichment'.

<table>
<tr>
<th>
whitelists/enrichment
</th>
<th>
whitelists/gene
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
<div>
The whitelist for enrichment is grouped into 'histone marks', 'proteins'<br>
and 'other'. The proteins correspond to the genes specified in the gene<br>
whitelist for each organism. By specifying the path to 'gene' whitelist,<br>
it can be linked under 'proteins', so that for this section the values<br>
from gene whitelist are adopted.
</div>
</td>
<td> 
<div>
The gene whitelist depends on the organism. This means that the 'proteins'<br>
part of the 'enrichment' whitelist is also dependent on the organism.
</div>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: group
whitelist:
    histone marks:
        - H2BK12ac
        - H2BK20ac
        ...
    proteins: gene
    other:
        - dmR24
        - dmR24delta
        ...
```

</td>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: depend
ident_key: organism_name
whitelist:
    human: genes/human
    mouse: genes/mouse
    zebrafish: genes/zebrafish
    rat: genes/rat
    pig: genes/pig
    medaka: genes/medaka
    chicken: genes/chicken
    drosophila: genes/drosophila
    yeast: genes/yeast
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


__Example 3 : depend__

Links can also be added for dependent whitelists. There are two ways to do this. Firstly, the paths to existing whitelists can be specified, as has already been done for 'plain' and 'group'. On the other hand, the keys under 'whitelist' can be omitted if the linked whitelist is named the same as the value it depends on. The following table shows both possibilities using the example of the whitelist for the key 'values'.

<table>
<tr>
<th> 
whitelists/factor
</th>
<th> 
whitelists/values
</th> 
<th> 
whitelists/values
</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
The whitelist for the experimental factors<br> 
is displayed here for overview. The values<br>
 in the whitelist for 'values' depend on <br>
 the factor entered from this list.          
</td>                                      
<td>                                       
The whitelist for values depends on the <br>
entered value under 'factor' and the <br>  
possible values should correspond to the <br>
values of the selected factor. For this <br>
reason, for each key under 'whitelist', <br>
the corresponding whitelist of the <br>   
experimental factor is linked.            
</td>                                     
<td>                                      
Each key in column two under 'whitelist' <br>
represents an experimental factor. The <br>
linked whitelist files show that the <br> 
respective whitelist is named the same as <br>
the factor whose possible values it <br>
contains. For this reason, it is possible <br>
to omit the keys for the experimental <br>
factors, since the program automatically <br>
searches for a whitelist with the same <br>
name as the key/experimental factor.
</td> 
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: plain
whitelist:
    - genotype
    - tissue
    - cell_type
    - knockdown
    - gender
    - life_stage
    - age
    - ethnicity
    - gene

</td>

```
</td>

<td>

```yaml

```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Subdivide whitelists into smaller files

If whitelists are very long, it may make sense to split them into smaller whitelists. This is especially helpful if the files are in a dependent whitelist. This way a separate whitelist file can be created for each key under 'whitelist'. This speeds up reading and processing, because in this case not all whitelist values have to be imported, but only those that fulfill the dependency. The following example shows the splitting of the whitelists for the whitelist 'gene'.

__Example:__

<table>
<tr>
<th> 
whitelists/gene
</th> 
<th> 
whitelists/genes/human
</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 
The whitelists for the genes per organism are very long, which is<br>
why they are outsourced to individual files. The keys are named <br>
after the organisms and the path to the respective whitelist is <br>
given as value. 
</td> 
<td> 
For the whitelists per organism a new folder 'genes' was created.<br>
The whitelists are named after the organism for which they <br>
contain the genes. The naming of the files does not follow any <br>
fixed rule but is subject to personal preference. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```yaml
whitelist_type: depend
ident_key: organism
whitelist:
  human_9606: genes/human
  mouse_10090: genes/mouse
  zebrafish_7955: genes/zebrafish
...
```

</td>
<td>

</tr>
