# Adding a key to the structure

To add a key to the data structure the file keys.yaml must be edited. The key must then be added at the appropriate position with the appropriate indentation. The properties of the new key must be specified. For this purpose, the structure described in [General structure](structure.md) must be adopted. It is important to note that all 8 properties should only be specified for leaf nodes. If the new key is an inner node, i.e. it contains further keys as value, then only property 1-5 are specified, whereby property 5 (default value) is given the further keys as value.
