# File Searching

## Programm Call

MetaTools includes a function to find metadata files using a search string over a specified path.

The find function of metaTools is called via
```bash
$ python metaTools.py find
```

with these arguments:

`-p, --path` the path over which to search

`-s, --search` the search string

To show the correct usage of the function, as well as all possible arguments in a help message, the function can also be called with the parameter:

`-h, --help` show help message

## Defining a search string

The search string contains the value values to be searched for which must be enclosed in double quotes. Multiple search values can be linked via 'and', 'or' and 'not'.
The conjunction 'and' corresponds to a logical and, whereas the conjunction 'or' corresponds to a logical or. By prepending a 'not' to the specified value, a search is performed for all values that do not correspond to it.

__Examples:__

`-s "human"` search for files that contain 'human'

`-s 'not "human"'` search for files that do not contain 'human'

`-s '"human" and "mouse"'` search for files that contain 'human' and 'mouse'

`-s '"human" or "mouse"'` search for files that contain 'human' or 'mouse'

### Increase accuracy

Specifying a simple value, such as 'human' in the search string will cause all fields within the yaml file to be searched.
If only a specific field should contain the searched value, a key can be specified to limit the search. The key is placed in front of the value and separated from the value with a colon. 

e.g.

`-s 'organism_name:"human"'` searches for Files that contain 'humam' as organism

Multiple keys can also be chained together with colons to narrow the search even further. However, it should be noted that the order of the keys must match the indentations within the underlying yaml structure.

__Example:__

The following yaml shows the structur of the keys for the project part.

```yaml
project:
    project_name:
    date:
    owner:
        name:
        ldap_name:
        department:
        email:
        address:
        telephone:
    nerd:
        name:
        ldap_name:
        department:
        email:
        address:
        telephone:
    description:
    further_description:
    graphical_abstract:
```
`-s "Walter, Jasmin"` search for 'Walter, Jasmin' in all fields

`-s 'name:"Walter, Jasmin"'` search for 'Walter, Jasmin' in all 'name' fields

`-s 'owner:name:"Walter, Jasmin"'` search for 'Walter, Jasmin' in the 'name' field of 'owner'

`-s 'project:name:"Walter, Jasmin"'` no functional search string, because the order of the keys within the underlying yaml structure is not met, functional alternatives are `-s 'project:owner:name:"Walter, Jasmin"'` or `-s 'project:nerd:name:"Walter, Jasmin"`

### Using brackets

Round brackets in the search string are used to specify the order of evaluation.

If search strings are concatenated with 'and' and 'or', 'and' is normally evaluated first.

e.g. 

`gender:"female" or gender:"male" and organism_name:"human"` 

is evaluated as 

`gender:"female" or (gender:"male" and organism_name:"human")`

To explicitly specify the order in which the individual search terms are to be evaluated, round brackets can be integrated in the search string. The content within the round brackets is then evaluated first. It is also possible to nest several round brackets, in which case they are evaluated from the inside out.
